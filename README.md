# Frontend Website – A Tribute to Dr. Mladen Radić

This repository contains a simple **HTML + CSS frontend website** created as a personal tribute and expression of gratitude to my doctor, **Dr. Mladen Radić**, a gastroenterologist who played a crucial role in my recovery.

Thanks to his expertise, approach, and treatment, I was able to overcome severe and long-lasting gastrointestinal issues. Today, I can once again do the things I love and want to pursue — **without pain or limitations**. This website is a small but sincere way of saying thank you for a life-changing improvement in my quality of life.

> ⚠️ **Note:** The website content itself is written in **Croatian**.
